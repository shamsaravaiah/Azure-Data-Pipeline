# Azure Data Pipeline Project
This project provides a comprehensive end-to-end solution for data management and analytics. It starts by ingesting data from an on-premise SQL Server database using Azure Data Factory and storing it in Azure Data Lake. The raw data is then processed and transformed into its cleanest form using Azure Databricks. The clean data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for further analysis. Finally, Microsoft Power BI is utilized to create interactive dashboards by integrating with Azure Synapse Analytics. The project also incorporates Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault to ensure robust monitoring, governance, and security.


##the project starts out with resource creation, down below are the resources I have created to use in this project:-


This project demonstrates the creation and management of various Azure resources as part of a data pipeline setup. Below are the resources created for this project:
